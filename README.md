# Backend branch in Rust


## Expariments
NOTE: Due to some issues with getting the .gitignore up and running correctly I lost branch info on diesal and first part of setting up sea-orm. That's why there are the `_diesel_migrations` incase I decide to go back to diesel.


- tried diesal a little bit
- decided to go with sea-orm as a first go
- have cors working with a react fe using vite
